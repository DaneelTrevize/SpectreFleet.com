Thank you for applying to Spectre Command!

After reviewing your application, we'd like to move forward with a short interview in order to get to know you better. Assuming all goes well, you'll be leading fleets as a Junior FC within the week. Please contact "<?=$Accepter?>" to set up an interview time.

First, please log into your FC account at <url=https://spectrefleet.com>spectrefleet.com</url>

Username: "<?=$Username?>"

You can simply use the SSO-based login, or your Spectre-specific password, or our SSO-based Password Reset feature should you forget it.

Make sure to familiarize yourself with the Spectre Fleet FC Guide, which can be found on the sidebar of the User Portal. The FC guide is full of helpful tips and guidelines for how to get started, even if you are completely unfamiliar with how an NPSI organization operates. Read the guide, and bring any questions you might have to the intial interview.

Once you feel ready, you'll need to join our Discord server by going here: <url=https://discord.gg/0bez8R0vmD5wGxY1>Spectre Fleet Discord</url>. In the #general channel you can either ping myself, or anyone with a purple colored name in order to schedule an interview. The interview should take no more than 15 minutes, and access to both Mumble and Discord is required.

Regards,
<?=$Accepter?>
