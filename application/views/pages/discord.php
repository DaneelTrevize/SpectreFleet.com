					Spectre Fleet is an Online Gaming Community that was founded in 2013. What started as a small group of friends who had met through Eve Online, has since become a large community with over 8000 active members from every major timezone. As a community we focus on the social aspect of gaming, providing a place where gamers can hang out and play together, with no obligations.

					Discord is a free tool that provides both voice and text chat for gamers. Discord is available on iOS, PC, and Android, and allows you to keep track of in-game events as they happen without having to be logged into the game. Share battlereports, plan for upcoming events, or just hangout!

					Discord can be used in any browser, however <a href="https://discordapp.com/download">downloading the app</a> is highly recommended.
