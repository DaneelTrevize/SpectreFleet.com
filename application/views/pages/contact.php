					Spectre Fleet is an Online Gaming Community that was founded in 2013. What started as a small group of friends who had met through Eve Online, has since become a large community with over 8000 active members from every major timezone. As a community we focus on the social aspect of gaming, providing a place where gamers can hang out and play together, without any obligations.

					If you need to contact a member of the Spectre Fleet Command Team regarding in-game matters, it is easiest to use Eve Mail, Mumble, or Discord. Most general questions can be answered by reading the main channel's MOTD, or by reading the welcome mail in the Spectre Fleet mailing list.
