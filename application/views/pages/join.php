					Spectre Fleet is an Online Gaming Community that was founded in 2013. What started as a small group of friends who had met through Eve Online, has since become a large community with over 8000 active members from every major timezone. As a community we focus on the social aspect of gaming, providing a place where gamers can hang out and play together, with no obligations.

					It’s easy to join the Spectre Fleet community!  Simply join the “SF Spectre Fleet” chat channel in Eve Online and read through the Message Of The Day.  Listed there, you’ll find links to various kinds of information, as well as a schedule of upcoming events.  Any active fleets will be listed last, along with a link to the channel where further information about the fleet will be provided.  Feel free to join the chat, look at the upcoming activities, and get to know your fellow Spectre Fleet pilots.
